## 📌 Project Overview

Indian parents genuinely want to support their child’s career & academic journey — but most struggle with **what to do on a weekly basis**.

Conversations often turn into pressure.  
Guidance becomes comparison.  
Support becomes confusion.

Most existing solutions today are:
- static blog articles,
- one-time counselling sessions,
- or generic career advice that doesn’t adapt to the child or family context.

This project explores a different approach.

Instead of giving parents **more advice**, this app focuses on giving them **clear, actionable steps** they can follow every week.

## 🎯 What This App Does

The **AI Career Companion for Parents** is a prototype that:

1. Understands a parent’s concerns, behaviour, and child’s academic context  
2. Identifies possible **parenting blind spots** (pressure, comparison, unclear expectations)  
3. Generates a **personalised 12-week micro-action plan** for parents  

Each week includes:
- one meaningful conversation to have,
- one exposure activity for the child,
- one boundary or habit the parent should maintain.

The focus is on **small, realistic actions**, not life-changing decisions.

## 🧩 How the System Works (High Level)

The app is built using an **agent-based approach**, inspired by Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) principles.

Instead of one monolithic AI prompt, responsibilities are separated conceptually:

### 🧠 Parent Profiler (Agent)
- Analyses parent inputs
- Detects behavioural patterns and blind spots
- Identifies the child’s current career stage

### 📅 Plan Designer (Agent)
- Converts insights into structure
- Produces a 12-week, week-by-week action plan
- Keeps actions practical for Indian households

For the MVP, these agents run sequentially to demonstrate the core idea end-to-end.
